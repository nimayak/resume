               Majoring in Software Development and Immunology has allowed me to develop creative and analytical skills, as well as developing my professionalism in which I can apply in the industry. Having taken an interest in the front-end development and UX design area of software development I chose units such as ‘usability’ and ‘advanced web design’ that helped me further my skills. </p>
               <p>The usability unit enabled me to understand the theories and principles of usability as applied to interface and interaction design and how to apply usability principles to the design of interfaces for Web, small screen and mobile devices. </p>
               <p>In my advanced web design unit I was able to the design and develop mobile online apps using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and WordPress. I learnt how to analyse, evaluate and design responsive web layouts for touch screen and mobile devices and how to implement this functionality for web applications.
